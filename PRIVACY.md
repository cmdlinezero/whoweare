# Privacy Policy for QUIZZRR
Effective Date: May 1, 2025

Thank you for using QUIZZRR! This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information in connection with our mobile application.

## 1. No Collection of Personal Information
We want to assure you that QUIZZRR does not collect any personally identifiable information from you. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Your name
* Your email address
* Your phone number
* Your location data
* Your device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, MAC address)
* Your contacts
* Your browsing history
* Any information you might input into the app (e.g., in-app chat, user profiles, if these features were to exist in the future)

Since QUIZZRR does not collect any personal information, we do not share, store, or otherwise process such data.

## 2. Non-Personal Information
We may collect certain non-personal information automatically. This type of information cannot be used to identify you directly. Non-personal information may include:
Aggregated and anonymized usage data: This includes information about how users generally interact with the app, such as the number of active users, the types of quizzes played, and the overall flow within the application. This data is collected and analyzed in a way that does not identify individual users.
Technical information about your device: This may include the type of device you are using, the operating system version, and the app version. This information helps us to ensure the app functions correctly across different devices and to understand general trends in technology usage.
This non-personal information is used for the following purposes:
To improve and optimize the functionality and user experience of QUIZZRR.
To understand general usage patterns and trends.
For internal analytics and reporting purposes.
## 3. Third-Party Services
QUIZZRR may utilize third-party services, such as analytics providers, that may collect non-personal information about your use of the app. These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. However, we reiterate that QUIZZRR itself does not share any personal information with these third parties because we do not collect it in the first place.
## 4. Children's Privacy
QUIZZRR is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or other applicable age depending on your jurisdiction). As we do not collect any personal information, the specific provisions of child privacy laws are not directly applicable to QUIZZRR. However, we are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users, regardless of age.
## 5. Data Security
Since we do not collect or store any personal information, the risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access are significantly minimized. We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of the non-personal information we may collect.
## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on our website (if applicable), and the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy will be updated. Your continued use of QUIZZRR after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated privacy policy.
